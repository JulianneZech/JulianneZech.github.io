	<h1>Julianne Zech</h1>
        <p>Hello world! I'm a senior at Georgetown University pursuing a double major 
	in computer science and math. My interests include machine learning, 
	data science, and natural language processing. When I'm not in class or working on a project, you can probably
	find me exploring the DC restaurant scene or whipping up my own culinary creation. </a></p>
