	<h1>Julianne Zech</h1>
        <p>Hello world! I'm a junior at Georgetown University pursuing a double major 
	in computer science and math. My interests include machine learning, 
	data science, and entrepreneurship. When I'm not in class, you can probably
	find me trying a new DC restaurant or whipping up my own culinary creation. </a></p>
